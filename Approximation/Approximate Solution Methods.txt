How can experience with a limited subset of the state space be usefully
generalized to produce a good approximation over a much larger subset?

generalization often called function approximation(FA) takes examples from a desired function (e.g., a value function) and attempts
to generalize from them to construct an approximation of the entire function
(FA) instance of supervised learning, the primary topic studied in machine
learning, artificial neural networks, pattern recognition, and statistical curve fitting

kthe approximate value function is represented not as a table but as a
parameterized functional form with weight vector w 2 Rd.

updating at s generalizes, many other states are changed as well

learning be able to occur online,
